SimpleFx
========

This is a currency converter app that's currently on the app store as SimpleFx.

I initially wrote it for a summer programme held by Apple called Cocoa Camp. After I was accepted on the program for summer 2013, I decided to

a) Publish the app on the app store (with some changes of course)
b) Move the code to github for my personal portfolio.

Feel free to fork this repository and then make pull requests if you want to improve it. It is unlikely that I will be making (significant) updates to this app in the future.
